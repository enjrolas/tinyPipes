A modified version of Wayne Truchsess' I2C Master library.
http://dsscircuits.com/articles/arduino-i2c-master-library.html

Modified by Thomas Backman <serenity@exscape.org>

Two noteworthy changes have been made:
1) This version uses 16-bit addresses instead of 8-bit (thus the modified name)
2) Supports "acknowledge polling", a technique used for the 24XX1025 EEPROM

This isn't intended to be a replacement for his library; on the contrary,
I only expect this to be used with my 24XX1025 EEPROM library.
Still, feel free to use it if you need the modifications.

Needless to say, the LGPL license remains.
